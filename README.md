# HORISEON
  Challenge to adjust existing code codebase that follows accessibility standards
so that our own site is optimized for search engines.
  **Refactoring** existing code (improving it without changing what it does)
to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common
task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular Challenge, a marketing 
agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.
  The most challenging was to identify and simplify the scc styling to make sure
it stayed the same as an idea, but was much shorter.
  this exercise was espesially helpfull to understand, finaly, how to see the weblite
through the code.
